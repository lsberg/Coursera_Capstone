    "\n",
    "1) From Geocode I will create a querry to get the latitude and longitude of both Evanston and Oak Park\n",
    "\n",
    "2) I will then utilize the Foursquare API to fetch data on all the venues and point of interest within 1km of the latitude and longitude acquired in step # 1\n",
    "\n",
    "3) I will process and clean-up the json file in order to convert to a dataframe and use with the pandas library\n",
    "\n",
    "4) With the dataframe we will use one hot encoding and classify each venue type by frequencies for both neighborhoods. This should make comparison straighforward\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Finally we will leverage clustering and other machine learning methods to further deepen our analysis and compare how similar or dissimilar both neighborhoods are\n",
